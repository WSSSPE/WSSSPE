\begin{abstract}

This article summarizes motivations, organization, and activities of the Fourth Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE4). The WSSSPE series promotes sustainable research software by positively impacting principles and best practices, careers, learning, and credit. This article includes the code of conduct; the mission and vision statements that were drafted at the workshop and finalized shortly after it; the keynote and idea papers, position papers, experience papers, demos, and lightning talks presented during the workshop; and a panel discussion on best practices. The main part of the article discusses the set of working groups that formed during the meeting, along with contact information for readers who may want to join a group. Finally, it discusses a survey of the workshop attendees.

% It also summarizes a set of lightning
% talks in which speakers highlighted to-the-point lessons and challenges
% pertaining to sustaining scientific software.
% The final and main contribution of the report is a summary of the
% discussions, future steps, and future organization for a set of self-organized
% working groups on topics including developing pathways to funding scientific
% software; constructing useful common metrics for crediting software
% stakeholders; identifying principles for sustainable software engineering
% design; reaching out to research software organizations around the world; and
% building communities for software sustainability. For each group, we include a
% point of contact and a landing page that can be used by those who want to join
% that group's future activities. The main challenge left by the workshop is to
% see if the groups will execute these activities that they have scheduled, and
% how the WSSSPE community can encourage this to happen.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


The Fourth Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences
(WSSSPE4)\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe4/}} was
held over 2 1/2 days on 12--14 September 2016 in Manchester, England, with 68 attendees.
This location and date was selected so that WSSSPE4 immediately preceded the
First Research Software Engineers (RSE) Conference.
Previous WSSSPE events\footnote{The first WSSSPE workshop was named
``Working towards
Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences,'' which remains the meaning
of the WSSSPE group, but the workshops after that were named
``Workshop on Sustainable
Software for Science: Practice and Experiences.'' Together these reflect
that WSSSPE is both a community and a set of workshops.}, all of which were in the US, were two general, presentation-focused, one-day workshops held with the SC13 and SC14 conferences~\cite{WSSSPE1-pre-report,WSSSPE1, WSSSPE2-pre-report,WSSSPE2},
two half-day workshops\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe1-1/}, \url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe2-1/}} held with SciPy 2014 and 2015 that contained presentations about specific sustainable Python software packages, and a 1-and-1/2-day workshop that included teams that self-assembled and discussed focused software sustainability topics~\cite{WSSSPE3}.
%
Based on the work done at these previous WSSSPE meetings, WSSSPE4 was aimed
at producing working groups that would better continue working after the workshop ended.

Specific topics that were discussed in previous meetings and suggested for WSSSPE4 included:

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\textbf{\theenumi}.}
\setlength{\rightmargin}{1em}

\item Development and Community:
best practices for developing sustainable software;
models for funding specialist expertise in software collaborations;
software tools that aid sustainability;
academia/industry interaction;
refactoring/improving legacy scientific software;
engineering design for sustainable software;
metrics for the success of scientific software; and
adaptation of mainstream software practices for scientific software

\item Professionalization:
career paths;
RSE as a brand;
RSE outside of the UK or Europe; and
Increase incentives in publishing, funding and promotion for better software

\item Training:
training for developing sustainable software; and 
curriculum for software sustainability

\item Credit:
making the existing credit and citation ecosystem work better for software;
future credit and citation ecosystem;
software contributions as a part of tenure review;
case studies of receiving credit for software contributions; and
awards and recognition that encourage sustainable software

\item Software publishing:
journals and alternative venues for publishing software; and
review processes for published software

\item Software discoverability/reuse:
proposals and case studies

\item Reproducibility and testing:
reproducibility in conferences and journals; and
best practices for code testing and code review

\end{itemize}

%\todo{Introduction}

WSSSPE4 included multiple mechanisms for participation and
encouraged team building around solutions. It strongly encouraged participation
of early-career scientists, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students,
early-stage researchers, and those from underrepresented groups,
with funds provided to the conference organizers by the National Science
Foundation (NSF), the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Alfred P.~Sloan Foundation, and the Software
Sustainability Institute (SSI) to support the travel of potential participants
who would not otherwise be able to attend the workshop. These
funds allowed 29 additional attendees % to attend and participate. A subset of the
% organizing committee reviewed 
(of 44 applicants), 
% ions for travel support and
% competitively selected the awardees, 
including 11 students and five early-career
researchers.
%  In addition, the travel award subcommittee tried to increase the
% diversity of applicants by forwarding the notice of travel support to
% organizations including PyLadies\footnote{\url{http://www.pyladies.com}},
% Django Girls\footnote{\url{https://djangogirls.org}},
% Women Who Code\footnote{\url{https://www.womenwhocode.com}}, and
% Women in HPC\footnote{\url{http://www.womeninhpc.org}}.
%\todo{did we reach out to any others?}
%
WSSSPE4 also included two professional event organizers/facilitators who helped
plan the workshop agenda,
and who engaged with participants during the workshop.

This paper is a summary of a longer report~\cite{WSSSPE4-report} on the workshop and the submitted materials.
The remainder of the paper includes the call for papers (\S\ref{sec:preworkshop}); the WSSSPE Code of Conduct (\S\ref{sec:CoC}) and mission and vision (\S\ref{sec:mission}); a set of presentations that included a keynote, papers, lighting talks, and a panel (\S\ref{sec:presentations}); and the activities of a set of working groups (\S\ref{sec:WGs}).  One full day of the
workshop was spent with participants in the working groups, which occurred in parallel
with each other.  And each of the working groups left with a plan for how they could move
forward.
This report also highlights an attendee survey (\S\ref{sec:survey}) before concluding (\S\ref{sec:conclusions}).
%An appendix lists the organizers and program committee members (\S\ref{sec:orgcom}).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Call for participation} \label{sec:preworkshop}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Post-WSSSPE3 feedback said that attendees
had two distinct motivations for attending:  to make a better future
for research software, and to immediately do better research software development. Thus,
WSSSPE4 was %partially 
planned as two tracks:

\begin{quote}
    \textbf{Track 1 -- Building a sustainable future for open-use research
    software}: defining a vision of the future of open-use
    research software, and in the workshop, initiating the activities that are
    needed to get there.

    \noindent \textbf{Track 2 -- Practices \& experiences in sustainable scientific software}:
    improving the quality of today's research software and the
    experiences of its developers by sharing best practices and experiences.
\end{quote}

The call for participation requested:
idea papers, implementable proposals related to Track~1;
position papers, longer, not previously published papers
discussing what we can do to improve sustainable scientific
software in the short term;
experience papers, longer papers that discuss current
experiences and how they have been used to improve the quality of
today's research software and/or the experiences of its developers;
demos, brief papers describing a tool or
process that would be demonstrated that improves the quality of today's research
software and\slash or the experiences of its developers; and
extended abstracts describing lightning talks,
where each author could make a brief statement about work that either had been
done or was needed.

%Suggested contribution topics included:

%\end{itemize}

Submissions to WSSSPE4 comprised
19 lightning talks,
4 idea papers,
3 position paper,
5 experience papers,
and
3 demos.
Most submissions were accepted, since the goal of WSSSPE is always to
take in as many relevant inputs as possible, and to encourage their authors to
participate in sharing and implementing their ideas. Two submitted lightning talks and one submitted experience paper were rejected, while two more submitted experience papers
were accepted as lightning talks.
% Specifically,
% 19 lightning talks,
% 4 idea papers,
% 3 position papers,
% 2 experience papers,
% and
% 3 demos
% were accepted, as mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:presentations}.
%
The papers and lightning talks have been published as a volume in the CEUR Workshop Proceedings~\cite{WSSSPE4-proceedings}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Code of Conduct}\label{sec:CoC}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

WSSSPE4 introduced a Code of Conduct (CoC)\footnote{\label{footnote:CoC}\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe4/code-of-conduct/}}, which was conceived for the workshop and as guidance for the community of scientists that WSSSPE
supports, including their personal and online interactions (e.g., on
Twitter, in email lists, in Slack). This CoC is based on the
FORCE11 conference CoC~\cite{FORCE11:CoC}, which is in turn based on the Code4Lib
CoC~\cite{Code4Lib:CoC}.
The main guidelines are:
\begin{quote}
    WSSSPE events are community events intended for networking and collaboration
    as well as learning. We value the participation of every member of the
    community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling
    experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and
    courtesy to other attendees throughout the event and in interactions online
    associated with the event.

    The WSSSPE event organizers are dedicated to providing a harassment-free
    experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
    expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
    body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), technology choices,
    or other group status.

    To make clear what is expected, everyone taking part in WSSSPE events and
    discussions---speakers, helpers, organizers, and participants---is required
    to conform to the Code of Conduct\footnoteref{footnote:CoC}.

%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item Communicate appropriately for a professional audience including
%     people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not
%     appropriate for any event.

%     \item Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Be
%     mindful of jargon, which can sometimes exclude others from engaging in the
%     discussion.

%     \item Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist,
%     ageist, or exclusionary behavior are not appropriate.
%     \end{itemize}
 \end{quote}

The CoC was discussed at the beginning of WSSSPE4, with the CoC subcommittee
and a general email address for reporting concerns or incidents, or
asking questions.  One concern was raised after the first half day, 
% regarding how part of the workshop was being run, 
and we changed the workshop
to address this concern.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Mission and vision}\label{sec:mission}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\note{by Lorraine and Dan}

Going into WSSSPE4, WSSSPE had no formal mission or vision statement.
The organizers developed a strawhorse, which was presented to the participants early in the meeting.
The presentation included guidelines as well as examples from other similar communities.
The guidelines were that in general, an organization's mission should stand the test of time and state what the organization does; its vision should imagine what the world would look like if the organization is successful; and from which, focus areas could be used to establish the scope of the organization along with its goals.

The participants were 
%given time after the presentation to write down their  
invited to comment,
% Seven people volunteered to work on 
and 
%revising 
the mission and vision statements, were revised 
%incorporating these comments and presenting back to the community.
based on this feedback.
% the committee redrafted the mission and vision.
The committee added focus areas to clarify the organization's breadth and to keep the mission and vision simple and long-lasting.
Comments after the close of the meeting were also incorporated into the statements.
A final draft was put on GitHub and advertised
via the WSSSPE mailing list, Facebook group, and Twitter.
After two weeks without suggested changes, the final statements\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/about-wssspe/}}
%as shown below, 
were added
to the WSSSPE website.

% {\bf Mission.}
% WSSSPE is an international community-driven organization that promotes sustainable research software by addressing challenges related to the full lifecycle of research software through shared learning and community action.

% {\bf Vision.}
% We envision a world where research software is accessible, robust, sustained, and recognized as a scholarly research product critical to the advancement of knowledge, learning, and discovery.

% {\bf Focus areas.}
% WSSSPE promotes sustainable research software by positively impacting:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\bf Principles and Best Practices}. Promoting best practices in sustainable software
% \item {\bf Careers}. Developing and supporting career paths in research software development and engineering
% \item {\bf Learning}. Engaging in activities to promote peer learning and interaction
% \item {\bf Credit}. Ensuring recognition of research software as an intellectual contribution equal to other research products
% \end{itemize}

% \textbf{Definitions:}
% \emph{Sustainable software} has the capacity to endure such that it will continue to
% be available in the future, on new platforms, meeting new needs.
% The \emph{research software lifecycle} includes:
% acquiring and assembling resources (including funding and people) into teams and communities,
% developing software,
% using software,
% recognizing contributions to and of software,
% and
% maintaining software.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Presentations}\label{sec:presentations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\note{from Patricia}

The keynote was given by Patricia Lago and entitled ``The legacy of unsustainable software''.
%
Sustainability is broadly associated with natural ecologic systems. When we translate the notion of sustainability to software solutions, however, we often confuse {\em impact in a certain point in time} with {\em balanced and durable effects}. In addition, software sustainability adds a fourth dimension to environmental, social and economic aspects: technical sustainability, and hence higher complexity~\cite{Lago2015}.  Lago's keynote discussed the challenges (and some related ongoing research) of combining technical and environmental sustainability, providing a complementary angle to the workshop discussions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\section{Papers and demos} \label{sec:papers}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\note{Sandra Gesing will write this}

WSSSPE4 included the presentation of 12 10-minute talks (based on four idea papers, three position papers,
two experience papers, and three demos) that addressed a wide range of topics around
sustainability for software in science. These talks covered three main areas.
%
% The following four papers belong to the first area: the academic environment.
%For talks with multiple authors, an
% \textsuperscript{\textasteriskcentered} indicates the author who presented the talk.
%Four papers %,  
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Michael Heroux: \emph{Idea paper: Sustainable \& Productive:
% Improving Incentives for Quality Software}

% \item Christopher Gwilliams: \emph{Demo: Using industrial engagement to
% create and develop research ties within academia}
%~\cite{Gwilliams:2016ws} 
%belong to 
The first area was the academic environment, with four papers
that address diverse aspects ranging from incentives for quality software to
advocating a professional society for research software to roles and degrees for
research software engineers~\cite{Heroux:2016ws, GAllen:2016ws, Philippe:2016ws, Gwilliams:2016ws}.
%\end{itemize}
The second area was concerned with characteristics and needs of
research software and included five papers~\cite{Dubey1:2016ws, ChueHong:2016ws, Dubey2:2016ws, Queiroz:2016ws, Childers:2016ws}.

%\section{Best practices for scientific software panel discussion} \label{sec:panel}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\note{from Simon}

The final WSSSPE4 presentation was a panel %To investigate best practices for scientific software we brought together a panel
of five experts with different perspectives on ``Best Practices for Scientific Software.''
These were: Alice Allen, Editor, Astrophysics Source Code Library, who brought an understanding of the difficulties of organizing a community and curating their software;
Mike Croucher from the University of Sheffield and Rob Haines from the University of Manchester who are both Research Software Engineers with decades of experience of writing code for researchers;
Patricia Lago from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, who brought a fresh perspective on software sustainability from the point of view of its impact on society and business; and
Karthik Ram from the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, who brought his perspective on the practicalities of using scientific software to conduct his research as a data scientist.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Working groups} \label{sec:WGs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

After most of the lightning talks and other presentations, WSSSPE used three areas of a large room to let
attendees use sticky flip charts and sticky notes on the walls to suggest a vision on any aspect of the work, a gap or challenge, or a project idea.
Next, attendees organically formed groups around the flip charts, and 12 groups emerged.
Summaries of each group's activities follow; for more details
about the group discussions, see \cite{WSSSPE4-report}.



\subsection{Verifying best practices \& metrics for sustainable research software}
\label{sec:best-practices-sustainable}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\note{Ray to write this}

Many open source projects for research software document their best practices and metrics that
contribute to the sustainability of the software as well as to define their research software project's success.
%
This group will take the outputs of the WSSSPE efforts to identify best practices for creation of sustainable software for science/academia, and also the outputs of WSSSPE efforts to identify metrics for sustainable software for science/academia and cross-reference these with current open source research software that successfully uses modern software engineering.  This will allow the group to identify gaps on both sides.  
Anyone can join this group or obtain more information about it by sending an email to the verifying best practices \& metrics for sustainable research software group: <wssspe4-verify-best-practices@googlegroups.com>.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Software Sustainability Alliance}
\label{sec:alliance}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\note{Neil and Jean wrote this}

The Software Sustainability Alliance working group aims to establish an alliance between organizations interested in improving the sustainability of research software. Such an alliance would ease the collaboration between member organizations to improve the sharing of expertise, resources and best practices. It is currently seeking feedback on potential member organizations, as well as the aims and scope of this alliance.
Currently, point-to-point collaboration exists between organizations, but this inadvertently results in competition or redundancy within the sustainable software community. An alliance of software sustainability organizations would ease inter-organization collaboration, the promotion of software sustainability as well as would improve the pooling of competencies and the sharing of expertise.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Scientific Software Prototyping Infrastructure (S2PI)}
\label{sec:prototyping}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%from Santiago
There is a productivity bottleneck---yet to be solved---in HPC from the human
perspective, first identified in the 1980s~\cite{barstow1982automatic}. Of all
domain-specific scientists, only a percentage of those use simulations due to
perceptions mostly related to the difficulty of using and developing those tools.
XSEDE and other resources have become a gateway for successfully increasing the
basis of HPC scientific users by facilitating their access to infrastructure and
tools~\cite{towns2014xsede}, but the development challenge remains.
%
The group's objective is development of a prototype tool that allows domain scientists to generate
simulation prototypes through a simple, yet expressive declarative
strongly-typed programming language close to equational expressions. The result
of that specification is both an executable artifact as well as a specification
for scientific programmers to later flesh out completely and adapt to particular
infrastructures.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{CodeMeta}
\label{sec:CodeMeta}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\note{Alice to write this}

Research software is often not shared; that which is shared may not have much metadata associated with it, and that which does exist often does not travel further than the website on which the software resides. The CodeMeta project\footnote{\url{http://codemeta.github.io/}} wants to incentivize software developers to release their software, encourage the development of metadata for it, enable credit assignment and citation of research software, increase its discoverability, more easily track dependencies, and enable reuse of software metadata, all goals that WSSSPE attendees have great interest in supporting.  
%
While at WSSSPE4, the group greatly expanded the CodeMeta project README file to include a description of the project geared to those with little or no prior knowledge of the project, a list of contributors, information on how one can get involved, a brief project history and who is managing the project, and links to additional information.

Though a Google group mailing list has been established for the working group, the easiest way to engage with the CodeMeta project is through its Github repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta}}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{White paper on developing sustainable software}
\label{sec:best-practices-developing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\note{Sandra to write this}

Many diverse aspects and dimensions (such as economic, technical, environmental, and social) of developing sustainable software can be investigated,
This group aims to write white papers
that will focus on scientific environments and their implications, targeted at developers
and project managers of scientific software. Given the complexity of this field, it is important to select
a subset of sustainability aspects for the white papers. The idea is to create a series of papers instead of trying
to tackle all important topics in one paper.
%
While there are already a few papers available on best practices and sustainability of scientific software in general, the group's goal is to create a series of papers that lead to consensus in the community, tackle many diverse aspects, and stay up-to-date with new trends.
%
The GitHub repository for the white paper can be found at \url{https://github.com/WSSSPE/WG-Best-Practices}. For more information and requests, join the \texttt{\#wg-best-practices} channel at WSSSPE's Slack team.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Social science for scientific software}
\label{sec:social}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\note{from Stuart}

%Introduction to group here, including the overall objective of work in this area.



There is more and more academic research being done on topics related to software sustainability, including work on software engineering practices and management of open source projects. However, academic research in general is often siloed for many reasons, and work on topics relevant to software sustainability is no exception. 
%
This working group is motivated by the goal of building better connections between academic researchers who are studying topics in or relating to software sustainability with practitioners, managers, and administrators who are working in the area of software sustainability.
%
The working group plans to briefly survey existing literature to get a better sense of the academic research landscape, facilitate some initial dialog between academic researchers and practitioners at WSSSPE4, then identify needed actions that would be mutually beneficial to researchers and practitioners. This plan resulted in the creation of the following SMART steps listed in the next section.

To join the group, one can join its mailing list at \url{https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/researchsoftwarestudies}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Software best practices for undergraduates}
\label{sec:best-practices-undergrads}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\note{Jonah Miller to write this}

This working group was motivated by the perceived prevalence of
so-called ``hidden code'' in scientific communities: code written by
individual researchers in an unsustainable way that is never shared
with the larger community. 
%
The participants hypothesized that the best strategy is to catch
researchers while they are still in training and teach them software
best-practices. Therefore, this working group's goal
is to develop courses on software best practices aimed at
undergraduate students studying domain science. The program might be
similar to a Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry workshop but
focused for domain scientists.

The development of a successful curriculum relies on the expertise of
software engineers to describe the best practices, domain experts to
describe model problems and workflow, and instructors to formulate
the pedagogy. Ideally these people will be brought together for a
short workshop or hackathon with the goal of drafting the
curriculum. 
Anyone interested in contributing should get in touch via one of the
following methods:

\begin{itemize}
\item Join the Google Group/mailing list
  \cite{WSSSPEUndergradGoogleGroup}.
\item Join the WSSSPE Slack (\S\ref{sec:slack}) and the
  \texttt{\#wg-undergraduatecourse} channel.
\item Ask to join the WSSSPE4-undergraduate-course organization
  \cite{WSSSPEUndergradGithub}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Meaningful metrics for sustainable software}
\label{sec:metrics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\note{content from Emily}

This group aims to increase the visibility of the quality of scientific software, facilitate the reusability of scientific software, and promote the best software practices by standardizing metrics via interviews with scientific software developers. This working group believes improving the current software metrics system will increase software sustainability. Currently, there are inefficiencies regarding software duplication, sustainability, and selection, as well as others, within the scientific software community. In order to address these inefficiencies, the group aims to create a goal-oriented method to collecting productive metrics by focusing on the developer side of software.

For more information, one can contact Emily Chen at <echen35@illinois.edu>.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Coordinating access to continuous integration (CI) for research software}
\label{sec:access}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\note{%Mark Abraham to write this?  Needs confirmation or another volunteer -
%Dan starting this for now - may poll other members of group to make progress}

Each developer of software with uncommon needs (hardware, software, libraries, data sets), non-public code, or tests that exceed time limits for free plans must acquire, setup, and maintain their own continuous integration systems because their needs make them ineligible for popular free services such as Travis CI.  For example, software groups that develop BIOUNO, CI4SI, or GROMACS have done this.

This group is interested in reducing the burden of different projects having to build and maintain their own continuous integration systems (when publicly available CI are not a fit), by coordinating and sharing this burden across multiple projects.
%

However, there are a lot of open issues such as how can the group learn from existing similar work without reinventing the wheel. Some possible goals include to acquire additional hardware such as GPUs, Xeon PHI, FPGAs and add/share them to, e.g., Debian's testing infrastructure or to extend Debian's scope to include published but not mature software.

For more information, see \url{https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/continuous-integration-for-research-software}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Software engineering processes tailored for research software}
\label{sec:soft-eng}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\note{Anshu to write this}

This working group is concerned with identifying processes that are not adequately
covered by general software engineering, starting with verification and testing.
Computational science and engineering applications have many moving
parts that need to interoperate with one another. The accuracy and
reliability of results produced by scientific software depends not
only on the individual components behaving correctly, but also on the
validity of their interactions.
A big challenge is that those who understand
the importance of regular testing do not often find much help from
software engineering literature. There is a significant gap between
the testing gospel and its applicability to computational science. This
gap leads to frustration and abandonment of the good with the bad. 

This working group will (1) conduct a literature survey to gauge the extent
of awareness of the issue in general, (2) generate content useful for
the community where needed, and (3) curate the collected and added
content for the use of the community.

Readers interested in getting more information should use the working group'
channel in the WSSSPE Slack (\S\ref{sec:slack}), called
\texttt{\#wg-testing-in-science}.
Additionally, a git
repository (\url{https://github.com/WSSSPE/WG-Best-Practices.git}) exists for contributing content and reference to, and
curation of the existing literature on this topic.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Open research index}
\label{sec:open-research-index}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\note{Dan to write this}

The aim of this group is to investigate the building of an index of research products in an open sustainable manner.  Its goal is not to eliminate commercial products, but to build on what is there and provide data and services that are missing.
%
The Open Research Index should take in all research products (papers, software, datasets, workflows, etc.) from their publishers and recorders (journals, societies, domain repositories, government [open access] repositories, preprint servers, general repositories [e.g., figshare, zenodo]) and other services (CrossRef, ORCID).
Each product should list authors and citations and allow people to search the resulting network.
Users should also be able to interact with their own record and edit it, like Google Scholar allows.

The working group's plans are relatively simple to express, though quite complex to undertake. A leader needs to be identified.
With a leader and feasible plan, the group would then obtain resources, and then build the index.
%
Because Google and others provide some similar services today, though these services (and the underlying data) could be removed at any time and the community cannot build new services, these companies would ideally be involved in the activities of the group.

Alternatively or additionally, the group could build a mailing list for us and discuss further, depending on how receptive others are to this idea.  At WSSSPE4, there seemed to be enough interest to do this, so the group set up a Slack channel within the WSSSPE team (\S\ref{sec:slack}), called \texttt{\#wg-open-research-idx} for its members and any future members.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Letters of evaluation for computational scientists}
\label{sec:letters}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Scientists working on scientific software are often located in
disciplinary departments, depending on whether their software
originates from the mathematical, physical, chemical, or other
disciplines. As a consequence, they are frequently outside the core
areas of their science, and their contributions are typically to both
the research activity their software enables, as well as on
algorithm and implementation aspects. This presents issues when
letters of evaluation for hiring, tenure, and promotion do not specifically
cover how this is relevant to the discipline.\footnote{The extensive use of such letters, and the problems that are
  associated with it, may be an issue specific to the United States.}

Consequently, letter writers neet to be aware of how their letters will be read by
committees. It also requires that committees be aware that such
letters often look different and may provide a different perspective
of how a candidate's achievements should be assessed. 

%
There are essentially two important strategies that build on each
other: (i) raising awareness of the problem beyond just those who are
affected by it, and (ii) providing letter writers, letter readers, and
evaluating committees with guidance on what criteria are relevant in
assessing scientific software authors.
%
Ultimately, building a community large enough
to affect change is important; contact Wolfgang Bangerth at
<bangerth@colostate.edu> if you are interested in helping.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Slack team and channels}\label{sec:slack}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


As part of the discussion at WSSSPE4, we created a Slack team for WSSSPE~\cite{WSSSPESlack}.  To join it, go to \url{https://wssspe.signup.team/}.  A number of the working groups also created channels within the team; see the other subsections in \S\ref{sec:WGs} for the names of these channels.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Attendee survey \label{sec:survey}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\note{from Lorraine}

At the end of WSSSPE4, all remaining participants completed an on-line survey.
%
%All participants present on the last day of the meeting, 14 September 2016, were asked to complete the online survey administered through Qualtrics\footnote{\url{https://www.qualtrics.com}.}.
%44 responses were recorded, with one respondent indicating that they took the survey twice.
%The survey URL was also later distributed to attendees by email and advertised on twitter for attendees who were not there on the last day to have a chance to respond, and one additional response was recorded after the meeting.
%Hence, the total number of unique individuals responding to the survey is likely 44.
%The survey contained nine multiple choice and open-text answer questions.
%Text responses have been alphabetized to preserve anonymity.
%The survey had a 100\% completion rate.
%
In general, the respondents were highly satisfied with the meeting and interested in continuing and participating in WSSSPE activities.
The mix of topics and types of interactions---talks, panels and discussion---was well balanced with several indicating a desire for time for questions and answers following talks as well for discussions in general.
Many respondents indicated that they will remain engaged in WSSSPE working group initiatives.
There was weaker demand for a professional organization encompassing WSSSPE interests, with over half interested in joining and a large percentage willing to consider the idea.
Respondents were grateful for the opportunity to network, explore new collaborations and for travel support to the conference.

The survey results indicate that future WSSSPE conferences should consider the balance of the attendees.
WSSSPE4 had many first time and early career participants who would have benefited from a review of basic concepts and terminology including what it means for software to be sustainable and the roles of research software engineers.
Additional emphasis and topics to explore would be the inclusion of more case studies, focus on the decision making process in developing and using software, deeper dives into selected topics, tutorials, software training within and outside of STEM, lowering the barriers to implementing best practices in software development, and progress towards executing WSSSPE's vision.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In WSSSPE4, we heard about a number of interesting projects and ideas, and used those
ideas to create and form working groups, intended to start at the workshop and then
continue afterwards, to address challenges that arose from the workshop ideas. This workshop
has reinforced the lesson from WSSSPE3 that it is relatively easy to get motivated people
to attend a meeting and productively spend their time there both doing work and planning
more work, but it is very hard to get that additional work after the meeting to take place.
The main problem seems to be one of time.  Once the attendees have agree to spend
their time at the workshop, they put their energy into doing so productively, but they have not
really committed themselves to anything more than this, so their energy and effort trails
off, as all of their other commitments (particularly, those they are funded to do as part of
their jobs) come back to the fore. Without a process to resolve this concern, the utility of
further multi-day WSSSPE workshops is unclear, at least to start new activities.  On a more
positive note, WSSSPE4 was successful as a gathering place to discuss scientific
software sustainability, and for groups that are already in place or that can be composed
of related funded activities to meet.  Future WSSSPE meetings will likely combine these
functions: a meeting place for like-minded individuals, a place to share experiences and
lessons learned, and a place for both existing groups and sets of related projects to meet
in person.  Other parts of the WSSSPE infrastructure (the email list and the Slack) will
be used both for general discussions, as well as for groups that choose to focus
on specific problems.

After WSSSPE4, we also have learned enough to summarize the areas of active work
in sustainable scientific software, based on the WSSSPE4 mission and vision statements, the WSSSPE4 call for participation (based on topics in previous WSSSPE meetings), and the working groups formed in WSSSPE4.  Following the example of the recently funded US project,
``Conceptualizing a US Research Software Sustainability Institute (URSSI)\footnote{\url{https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1743188}},'' the high-level
version of these areas is: functioning of 1) the individual and team, 2) the research software, and 3) the research field itself, with six specific topics, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:topics}
