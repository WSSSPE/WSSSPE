\subsubsection{Why it is important}
%\todo{short text here}

User communities are the lifeblood of sustainable scientific software. The user community includes the developers, 
both internal and external, of the software; direct users of the software; other software projects that depend on
the software; and any other groups that create or consume data that is specific to the software. Together these
groups provide both the reason for sustaining the software and, collectively, the requirements that drive its continued
evolution and improvement.
