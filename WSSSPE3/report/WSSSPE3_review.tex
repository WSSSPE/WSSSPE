\begin{abstract}
\todo{need to update for WSSSPE3}
This technical report records and discusses the Second Workshop on Sustainable
Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE2). 
%The workshop used an
%alternative submission and peer-review process, which led to a set of papers
%divided across five topic areas: 
The report includes a description of the alternative, experimental submission
and review process, two workshop keynote presentations, a series of lightning
talks, a discussion on sustainability, and five discussions from the topic areas
of exploring sustainability; software development experiences; credit \&
incentives; reproducibility \& reuse \& sharing; and code testing \& code
review. For each topic, the report includes a list of tangible actions that were
proposed and that would lead to potential change.
%
The workshop recognized that reliance on scientific software
is pervasive in all areas of world-leading research today. The workshop
participants then proceeded to explore different perspectives on the concept of
sustainability. Key enablers and barriers of sustainable scientific software
were identified from their experiences. In addition,
recommendations with new requirements such as software credit files and software
prize frameworks were outlined for improving practices in sustainable software
engineering.
%
There was also broad consensus that formal
training in software development or engineering was rare among the
practitioners. Significant strides need to be made in building a sense of
community via training in software and technical practices, on increasing their
size and scope, and on better integrating them directly into graduate education
programs.
%
Finally, journals can define and publish policies to improve reproducibility, whereas
reviewers can insist that authors provide sufficient information and access to
data and software to allow them reproduce the results in the paper. Hence a list of
criteria is compiled for  journals to provide to reviewers so as to make it easier to
review software submitted for publication as a ``Software Paper.''

\todo{need to update for WSSSPE3}
The Second Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and
Experiences
(WSSSPE2)\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe2/}} was
held on 16 November, 2014 in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, in
conjunction with the International Conference for High Performance Computing,
Networking, Storage and Analysis
(SC14)\footnote{\url{http://sc14.supercomputing.org}}. WSSSPE2 followed the
model of a general initial workshop,
WSSSPE1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe1/}}~\cite{WSSSPE1-pre-report,WSSSPE1},
which co-occurred with SC13, and a focused workshop,
WSSSPE1.1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe1-1/}},
which was organized in July 2014 jointly with the SciPy
conference\footnote{\url{https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/participate/wssspe/}}.

Progress in scientific research is dependent on the quality and accessibility of
software at all levels. Hence it is critical to address challenges related to
the development, deployment, maintenance, and overall sustainability of reusable
software as well as education around software practices. These challenges can be
technological, policy based, organizational, and educational, and are of
interest to developers (the software community), users (science disciplines),
software-engineering researchers, and researchers studying the conduct of
science (science of team science, science of organizations, science of science
and innovation policy, and social science communities). The WSSSPE1 workshop
engaged the broad scientific community to identify challenges and best practices
in areas of interest to creating sustainable scientific software. WSSSPE2
invited the community to propose and discuss specific mechanisms to move towards
an imagined future practice for software development and usage in science and
engineering. The workshop included multiple mechanisms for participation,
encouraged team building around solutions, and identified risky solutions with
potentially transformative outcomes. It strongly encouraged participation of
early-career scientists, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students, with
funds provided to the conference organizers by the Moore Foundation and the
National Science Foundation (NSF), to support the travel of potential
participants who would not otherwise be able to attend, and young participants
and those from underrepresented groups, respectively. These funds allowed 17
additional participants to attend, and each was offered the chance to present a
lightning talk.

This report extends a previous report that discussed the submission,
peer-review, and peer-grouping processes in detail~\cite{WSSSPE2-pre-report}. It
is also based on a collaborative set of notes taken with Google Docs during the
workshop~\cite{WSSSPE2-google-notes}. Overall, the report discusses the
organization work done before the workshop (\S\ref{sec:preworkshop}); the
keynotes (\S\ref{sec:keynotes}); a series of lightning talks
(\S\ref{sec:lightning}), intended to give an opportunity for attendees to
quickly highlight an important issue or a potential solution; a session on
defining sustainability (\S\ref{sec:defining}). The report also gives summaries
of action plans proposed by five breakout sessions, which explored in specific
areas including sustainability (\S\ref{sec:exploring}); software development
experiences (\S\ref{sec:devel}); credit \& incentives (\S\ref{sec:credit});
reproducibility, reuse, \& sharing (\S\ref{sec:reproduce}); code testing \& code
review (\S\ref{sec:code_testing}). Lastly, the report also includes some
conclusions (\S\ref{sec:conclusions}) and an incomplete list of attendees
(Appendix~\ref{sec:attendees}).

\section{Submissions, Peer-Review, and Peer-Grouping} \label{sec:preworkshop}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\note{this section is taken from \cite{WSSSPE2-pre-report}. It could be shortened.}

\todo{need to update for WSSSPE3}
WSSSPE2 began with a call for papers~\cite{WSSSPE2-pre-report}. Based on the
goal of encouraging a wide range of submissions from those involved in software
practice, ranging from initial thoughts and partial studies to mature
deployments, but focusing on papers that are intended to lead to changes, the
organizers wanted to make submission as easy as possible. The call for papers
stated:

\begin{quote} We invite short (4-page) \textbf{actionable} papers that will lead
to improvements for sustainable software science. These papers could be a call
to action, or could provide position or experience reports on sustainable
software activities. The papers will be used by the organizing committee to
design sessions that will be highly interactive and targeted towards
facilitating action. Submitted papers should be archived by a third-party
service that provides DOIs. We encourage submitters to license their papers
under a Creative Commons license that encourages sharing and remixing, as we
will combine ideas (with attribution) into the outcomes of the workshop.
\end{quote}

The call included the following areas of interest:
\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\textbf{\theenumi}.}

\end{quote}


31 submissions were received; all but one used arXiv\footnote{\url{http://arxiv.org}}
or figshare\footnote{\url{http://figshare.com}} to self-publish their papers.

The review process was fairly standard. First, reviewers bid for papers. Then an
automated system matched the bids to determine assignments. After the reviewers
completed their assigned reviews (with an average of 4.9 reviews per paper and
4.1 reviews per reviewer), they used EasyChair\footnote{\url{http://easychair.org/}} 
to record scores on relevance
and comments. Finally, the organizers accessed the information to decide which
papers to associate with the workshop and provided authors with the comments to
help them improve their papers.

The organizers decided to list 28 of the papers as significantly contributing to
the workshop, a very high acceptance rate, but one that is reasonable, given the
goal of broad participation and the fact that the reports were already
self-published.

The organizers wanted very interactive sessions, with the process of creating
the sessions open to the full program committee, the paper authors, and others
who might attend the workshop. In order to do this, the organizers used 
Well Sorted\footnote{\url{http://www.well-sorted.org}} with the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
%
\item Authors were asked to create Well Sorted ``cards'' for the papers. These
cards have a title (50 characters maximum) and a body (255 characters maximum).
%
\item Authors, members of the WSSSPE program committee, and mailing list subscribers
were asked to sort the cards. Each person dragged the cards, one by one, into
groups. A group could have as many cards as the person wanted it to have, and it
could have any meaning that made sense to that person.
%
\item Well Sorted produced a set of averages of all the sorts, with
various numbers of card clusters.
%
\end{enumerate}

The organizers then chose a sort that contained five groups that felt most
meaningful. After that, they decided on names for the five groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item Exploring Sustainability
\item Software Development Experiences
\item Credit \& Incentives
\item Reproducibility \& Reuse \& Sharing
\item Code Testing \& Code Review.
\end{itemize}

Finally, since some of the papers were not represented by cards in the process,
they were not placed in groups by the peer-grouping system. The authors of
these papers were asked which groups seemed the best for their papers; these
papers were then placed in those groups. Sections~\ref{sec:exploring}-\ref{sec:code_testing}
discuss the breakout groups, including a list of the papers associated with each
group.

\section{Keynote} \label{sec:keynote}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\todo{need to update for WSSSPE3}
The workshop featured two keynote addresses. In the opening keynote
presentation, Kaitlin Thaney of the Mozilla Science Lab talked about her
organization's work and policy to enable and support sustainable and
reproducible scientific research through the open web. The second keynote
speaker was Neil Chue Hong of Software Sustainability Institute. He shed
light on how scientific software is prevalently driving advances in many science
and engineering fields. Both keynote speeches spawned further discussion among
workshop participants on the crucial notion of \emph{software sustainability}
in the theme of our workshop.


Kaitlin Thaney is the Director of the Mozilla Science Lab (hereafter Mozilla), which
is a non-profit organization interested in openness, news, website
creation, and Science, all taking advantage of the open web.

Thaney started noting the unfortunate fact that many current systems suffer the
unintended consequence of creating friction that hinders users, despite
designers' original purposes to do good. An example is the National Cancer
Institute's caBIG. A total of \$350 million was spent, including more than \$60
million for management. More than $70$ tools were created, but caBIG is still
seen as a failure\footnote{Report Blasts Problem-Plagued Cancer Research Grid,
\url{http://tinyurl.com/maf6dz2}}. Those that had the least investment were the
most used; the most invested software were the least utilized.

Thaney emphasized that for efficient reproducible open research, we would need
research tools (e.g., software repositories), social capital (e.g., incentives),
and capacity (e.g., training and mentorship). Our systems would need to
communicate with each other. A point was made by a member of the audience that
as systems become less monolithic, it often becomes harder to sustain the links
between them\footnote{See, for example, \url{http://tinyurl.com/l76tba2}.}.
%http://www.slideshare.net/jameshowison/scientific-software-sustainability-and-ecosystem-complexity
%(but does Anon Grizzly have other cites/info for that?).
%In contrast, works licensed by Creative Commons typically do not
%have dependencies (a book, a photo, an artwork).

Thaney spoke about Mozilla's work around code citation, through a collaboration
and prototype crafted between Mozilla, GitHub, figshare, and Zenodo. This work
was presented at a closed meeting in May 2014 at the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) around these issues, sparking a conversation from that meeting
around what a \emph{Software Discovery
Index}\footnote{Software Discovery Index, \url{http://softwarediscoveryindex.org/report/}} might look
like. The meeting included a number of publishers, researchers, and those behind
major scientific software efforts such as
Bioconductor\footnote{Bioconductor, \url{http://www.bioconductor.org}},
Galaxy\footnote{Galaxy, \url{http://galaxyproject.org}}, and
nanoHUB\footnote{nanoHUB, \url{https://nanohub.org}}.
%facilitates more efficient scientific research. SDI identifies scientific
%software by archiving and standardizing metadata for software and hence help
%connect both developers and users.
Ted Habermann in the audience commented that if the metadata is minimal, it
would be less onerous for data providers, but more burdensome for users---it
could be challenging to keep a balance between what have to be captured and what
would be ideal if we do not want to lose user engagement as in the case of the
old Harvard Dataverse, finding often only the first four fields of three pages
of metadata were filled out.

The speaker concluded her talk urging the audience to design scientific software
with the general community, not an individual, in mind; and to design to unlock
latent potential of our systems. In addition, she encouraged everyone to rethink
how we reward researchers and support roles.
%Lastly, she cautioned the community to be mindful of jargon or semantics traps.

\section{Lightning Talks} \label{sec:lightning}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\todo{need to update for WSSSPE3}
\begin{comment}
\note{Lead: Choi. Volunteers welcome.
\href{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe2/lightning-talks/}{Slides.}}

Lighting talks, breakout groups, working groups are all different. Lightning
talks were new in WSSSPE2. They were offered to all paper contributors, and some
other attendees, those who got travel awards. Breakout groups in WSSSPE1 were
just discussions about topics; in WSSSPE2, the breakout groups were supposed to
come up with plans for actions in specific areas. The idea of working groups is
that they will come out of breakout groups as a way for the groups to actually
do the actions over time, not at the workshops.

\end{comment}

Lightning talks were a new feature in WSSSPE2. Since the workshop program was
mostly dedicated to discussions, the organizers wanted to give the attendees a
chance to also `make a pitch' for an idea, either representing a contributed
paper or something different. Eighteen attendees volunteered to participate in
the lightning talks, each given only two minutes to speak and at most one slide
to show. The talks were presented in reverse alphabetic order of speakers' last
names. In the rest of this section, we highlight the gist of some of the
speakers' messages.

%\item Greg Wilson: Close Enough for Scientific Work

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Colin C. Venters: The Nebuchadnezzar Effect: Dreaming of Sustainable
Software through Sustainable Software Architectures~\cite{Venters_poster}.}
Venters proposed that sustainable software is a composite, first-class,
non-functional requirement (NFR) that is at a minimum a measure of a system's
maintainability and extensibility, but may also include other NFRs such as
efficiency (e.g., energy, cost), interoperability, portability, reusability,
scalability, and usability. To achieve technically sustainable software, Venters
suggested that software architectures are fundamental as they are the primary
carrier of system NFRs, i.e., pre-system understanding; and influence how
developers are able to understand, analyze, extend, test, and maintain a
software system, i.e., post-deployment system understanding. In addition,
Venters highlighted that sustainability of software architectures needs to be
addressed to endure different types of change and evolution in order to mitigate
architectural drift, erosion, and knowledge vaporization.

%\item James Spencer: Developing New Developers

%\item Erin Robinson:  Sustaining Science Bazaars

\item \textbf{Marlon Pierce: Patching It Up, Pulling It
Forward~\cite{Pierce_poster}.} Pierce discussed how open open source is. Open
software needs a diverse, openly governed community behind it, just as it needs
open licensing and a public code repository. To probe the level of governance
within open source projects, he and his co-authors (Marru and Mattmann)
suggested a contest to encourage individual developers to submit
patches and requests to projects that are important to them. This simple
mechanism shall expose several governance mechanisms, such as how easy it is for
independent developers to communicate with project leadership, how projects
accept and license third-party contributions, and how projects make
decisions such as granting source tree write access.

\item \textbf{John Peterson: Continuous Integration for Concurrent MOOSE Framework
and Application Development on GitHub~\cite{Peterson_poster}.}
Peterson from the Idaho National Laboratory reported
that in March 2014, the MOOSE framework was released under an open source
license on GitHub, significantly expanding and diversifying the pool of current
active and potential future contributors on the project. The MOOSE team employs
an extensive continuous integration test suite to ensure that both the framework
and the applications based on the framework are verified before any code changes
are accepted into the repository. They use a combination of built-in Git
features such as branching and submodules, GitHub API integration capabilities,
and in-house developed testing software to perform this verification and update
the dependent applications in a relatively seamless manner for users.

\item \textbf{Abani Patra: Execute it~\cite{Patra_poster}.}
%Univ at Buffalo, SUNY
Patra discussed the value of an easily accessible platform for
executing scientific software, e.g., HUBzero to access XSEDE or other computing
resources. Such a platform for executing benchmark problems (even at a small
scale) allows the developer community access a reference implementation and
provides an easy way to train the larger user community. A second idea of this
talk was that for true usability, much more attention and support needs
to be given to the integrated use of simulation tools inside complex workflows.

%\item Christopher Lenhardt: Open Science for Synthesis (OSS): Filling the Gapin %Early Career Training

\item \textbf{Daniel S. Katz: Implementing Transitive Credit with
JSON-LD~\cite{Katz_transitive_credit_poster}.} Science and engineering research
increasingly relies on activities that facilitate research but are not rewarded
or recognized, such as: data sharing; developing common data resources, software
and methodologies; and annotating data and publications. To promote and advance
these activities, we must develop mechanisms for assigning credit, facilitate
the appropriate attribution of research outcomes, devise incentives for
activities that facilitate research, and allocate funds to maximize return on
investment. Katz discussed the issue of assigning credit for both direct and
indirect contributions by using JSON-LD to implement a prototype transitive
credit system.

\item \textbf{Samin Ishtiaq: Daemons, Notifications and Sustaining Software. }%~\cite{Ishtiaq_poster}}
%  Microsoft Research Cambridge
The reproduction and replication of novel results has become a major issue in
computer science, systems biology, and other computational disciplines. These
include both the inability to re-implement novel algorithms and approaches, and
lack of an agreement on how and what to benchmark these algorithms on. Ishtiaq
from Microsoft Research Cambridge pointed out these problems and made several
suggestions to address them.

\item \textbf{James Howison: Retract all Bit-Rotten Publications. }%~\cite{Howison_poster}
Howison sought to provoke discussion by proposing that papers whose workflows
are not kept current with the changing software ecosystem should be
automatically retracted. This would create an incentive for authors to keep
their software current and usable, rather than the current situation in which
every potential user has to do this individually. A softer version of the
proposal would identify papers whose software workflow has become bit-rotten and
allow others to keep the code up to date, either adding them as new authors of
the paper or providing credit for their academic service in some other form.

%\item Sarah Harris: Sustainability of Multidisciplinary Software: A Science
%Perspective

%\item Marcus D. Hanwell: We Need Tool Builders for Sustainable Scientific
%Software

%\item Ted Habermann: Communities as the Whole Product

\item \textbf{Robert Downs: Community Recommendations for Improving Sustainable
Scientific Software Practices~\cite{Downs_poster}.} Robert Downs, of the
Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network
(CIESIN), described a focus group study conducted with the Science Software
Cluster (SSC) of the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP).
For the study, almost 300 attendees of the 2014 Summer ESIP Meeting were invited
to participate in simultaneous roundtable discussions on sustainability of
science software. Over two-thirds of the roundtable focus groups responded to a
semi-structured survey that contained three sets of questions eliciting
recommendations for near-term actions of the community to improve sustainable
software practices. Initial analysis of the participants' responses to the
questionnaire revealed several suggestions, which included improving community
engagement and collaborative activities, increasing understanding and awareness,
and creating incentives to motivate sustainable science software practices. 
The ESIP SSC plans to engage the community in the recommended activities for
improving sustainable scientific software practices.

\item \textbf{Carl Boettiger: rOpenSci: Building Sustainable Software by
Fostering a Diverse Community~\cite{Boettiger_poster}.} Boettiger described how
the rOpenSci project has been successful by focusing not just on building
software but also on building a community of researchers who learn and adopt
their approaches to reproducible research and sustainable software practice.
Through outreach, mentoring, workshops, and hackathons, they have not only
reached new users, but also turned users into co-developers of robust software
and good practices to support data science research across a growing set of
disciplines.

\item \textbf{Jakob Blomer: The Need for a Versioned Data Analysis
Environment~\cite{Blomer_poster}.} Large-scale scientific endeavors, such as the
discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), often rely on
complex software stacks. Maintaining thousands of dependencies of software
libraries and operating system versions has shown that despite source code
availability, the setup and the validation of a minimal usable analysis
environment can easily become prohibitively expensive. In high-energy physics,
CernVM-FS, a special-purpose, open-source, versioning, and snapshotting file
system used to capture and distribute entire software stacks, proved to be
useful for providing instant access to ready-to-run data analysis environments.
% for the global scientific community as well as for
%interested citizens, for instance through the CERN Open Data Portal
%(http://opendata.cern.ch). \todo{revise}

\item \textbf{Alice Allen: Find it! Cite it! }%~\cite{Allen_poster}}
The Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL) is an online registry of
scientist-written software used in astronomy research. Their primary interest is
rendering research more transparent by making this software more discoverable for
examination. The ASCL is treated as a publication by an indexing resource for
astronomy, the Astrophysics Data System (ADS). ADS tracks citations to what it
indexes, including citations to ASCL entries. Increasing rewards for writing
software, whether through citation, transitive credit or other methods, gives
software authors a powerful reason to take the time to build sustainability into
their software and is an excellent way to drive community change.

\todo{need to update for WSSSPE3}
The WSSSPE2 workshop continued our experiment from WSSSPE1 in how we can
collaboratively build a workshop agenda, and we began a new experiment in
how to build a series of workshops into an ongoing community activity.

The differences in workshop organization in WSSSPE2 from WSSSPE1
are in using an existing service (EasyChair) to handle submissions and reviews,
rather than an ad hoc process, and using an existing service (Well Sorted) to
allow collaborative grouping of papers into themes by all authors, reviewers,
and the community, rather than this being done in an ad hoc manner by the
organizers alone.

The fact remains that contributors also want to get credit for their
participation in the process. And the workshop organizers will want to make
sure that the workshop content and their efforts are recorded. Ideally, there
would be a service that would index the contributions to the
workshop, serving the authors, the organizers, and the larger community. 
Since there still isn't such a service today, the workshop organizers are
writing this initial report and making use of arXiv as a partial solution to
provide a record of the workshop.

WSSSPE actively used the online social network Twitter, with hashtag
``\#WSSSPE''. There were substantially more tweets (messages) during the days of
the workshops WSSSPE2, WSSSPE1.1, and WSSSPE1. Out of about 670 tweets as of Apr
18, 2015, more than 225 were about WSSSPE2 and about 180 were posted during the
day of the workshop. Some of the main points and highlights in the meeting are
shown in Table~\ref{tab:tweets}, which summarizes the top \#WSSSPE tweets from
the day of workshop, selected by the metrics that number of retweets or
favorites larger than five and the sum of two measures greater than ten.

In terms of building community activities, we wanted to focus primarily on
working groups, which we were able to do, as discussed above, but we
also wanted to make sure that attendees felt they had a chance to get their
ideas across to the whole group, which was the purpose of the lightning talks.
Overall, this seemed to be successful at the time, in terms of both the lightning
talks and the breakout groups, and the discussion of sustainability also led
to interesting and useful results. However, the challenge that we have discovered
since WSSSPE2 is that it is very hard to continue the breakout groups'
activities.  The WSSSPE2 participants were willing to dedicate their time to
the groups while they were at the meeting, but afterwards, they have gone
back to their (paid) jobs.  We need to determine how to tie the WSSSPE
breakout activities to people's jobs, so that they feel that continuing them
is a higher priority than it is now, perhaps through funding the participants,
or through funding coordinators for each activity, or perhaps by getting
the workshop participants to agree to a specific schedule of activities during the
workshop.
